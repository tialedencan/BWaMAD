        <h2>Re:Eileen Dover university application</h2>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join at the University of Awesome's science faculty to 
            study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if 
            you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016 </li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important univesity dates</a> on our website.</p>
        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>At the Awesime Science Faculty, we have a pretty pen-minded research facility - as long 
            as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, 
            dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that, of the 
            ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exxceeding 30°C(86°F), when the 
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> &#62 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.) 
            </li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>    
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, includinf+g how long you'd expect the 
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i>study exotic trival dances. To answer your question,
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesianchicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but <em>very</em>influential dance dating back as fae as 300BC, a whole village would dance around 
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
            </dd>
            <dt>Icelanding brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed....</dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation,...</dd>

        </dl>
        <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page.</a></p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
